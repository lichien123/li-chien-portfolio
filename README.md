# Welcome to my portfolio!

In here, you'll get an overview of who I am, what I do as a web developer, what I've done in the past and what I'm currently doing.

## I'm always updating things here.

Life is a learning process. I am continually updating my portfolio to keep up with the trends. If it's changed since the last time you saw it, it means I'm improving :)

### Hope you enjoy browsing the site!

I don't want to give away too much. Go ahead and check it out!
